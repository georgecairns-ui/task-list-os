# Step 7: first run

Goal: the moment it all comes together. You fill the task list with their real work, from their real inbox, calls and calendar, and they open the app to find it already organised.

Read `apps/task-list/CLAUDE.md` first. It explains the task file and how to edit it safely.

## 7.1 Fill the task file

Edit `apps/task-list/data/tasks.json`:

1. Remove every task with `"example": true`.
2. **People:** add their team, key clients and suppliers from `context/people.md` to `people`.
3. **Calendar:** copy events from yesterday to 14 days ahead into `events` (see `apps/task-list/CLAUDE.md`).
4. **Inbox:** follow `.claude/skills/triage-inbox` for the **last 7 days**. Emails that need an answer go into `replies`, each with a draft in their voice. Requests and promises become suggested tasks. Fill in `triage` with the counts.
5. **Calls:** if a recorder is connected, follow `.claude/skills/process-calls` for the **last 14 days**. Each call goes into `meetings` with a summary, its actions as suggested tasks and a follow-up draft.
6. **Their own list:** ask one question, "Anything else on your mind that I won't have found in your email? Just list it." Add each line to `dump`, then follow `.claude/skills/sort-my-brain-dump`.
7. **Recurring jobs** from `context/routines.md` become tasks with their next due date.
8. **What you can do for them:** follow `.claude/skills/spot-claude-tasks`, so the tasks you could do show "Claude can do this" with a ready prompt.
9. **Today's plan:** follow `.claude/skills/sort-my-day`.
10. Save, read the file back and check it's valid.

## 7.2 Open it for them

Follow `.claude/skills/open-task-list`: start the task list, offer to make it start with the computer, then (with their yes) open **http://localhost:4747** in their browser. There's nothing for them to set up or connect.

Then tell them what's waiting, in this shape and in your own words:

> Your task list is open, and it's already full of your real work. I sorted 143 emails from the last week: 9 need a reply (I've drafted them all), and 6 have become tasks. I wrote up your 4 calls, with 11 actions. Today's plan has 7 suggestions.
>
> Your link is **http://localhost:4747**. Bookmark it.
>
> Start with your **Inbox**: press **Draft** on any of them and the email opens, written and addressed, ready for you to check and send. Then **Review** to approve the tasks I've suggested.

Tick step 7.
