# SAVE A KEY (Windows)
# --------------------
# Saves a key for one of your apps (for example your Fireflies API key) for your Windows account,
# so Claude Code can use it, without the key ever appearing in a chat or in your Task List OS folder.
#
# How to use it: open PowerShell in your Task List OS folder and run, for example:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup\scripts\save-key.ps1 FIREFLIES_API_KEY
# Then paste your key when asked and press Enter. Nothing shows while you paste; that's normal.
#
# It saves the key as an environment variable for your Windows user only.
# Afterwards: close PowerShell and Claude Code, then open them again so they pick it up.
