# SAVE A KEY (Mac and Linux)
# --------------------------
# Saves a key for one of your apps (for example your Fireflies API key) safely on this computer,
# so Claude Code can use it, without the key ever appearing in a chat or in your Task List OS folder.
#
# How to use it: open the Terminal app and run, for example:
#   bash "setup/scripts/save-key.sh" FIREFLIES_API_KEY
# Then paste your key when asked and press Enter. Nothing shows while you paste; that's normal.
#
# What it does:
#   On a Mac:   stores the key in your Keychain (the Mac's encrypted password store), and adds one
#               line to your shell profile that reads it from the Keychain when a terminal opens.
#               The key itself is never written into a file.
#   On Linux:   stores the key in ~/.config/task-list-os/<NAME>, readable only by you, and adds one
#               line to your shell profile that reads it.
# Afterwards: close the terminal, open a new one, and start Claude Code again from your folder.
